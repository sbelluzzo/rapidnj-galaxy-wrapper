# Galaxy wrapper for RapidNJ
A basic wrapper to provide use of [RapidNJ](http://birc.au.dk/Software/RapidNJ/) for the [Galaxy platform](http://galaxyproject.org/).

Currently cannot use Phylip style distance matrices or Stockholm format alignments; these datatypes don't appear to be included in a stock Galaxy install. Does use the "slots" system for CPU usage.
